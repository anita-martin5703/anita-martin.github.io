                This project was one of the first applications I built back in 2019 and it utilized the Java language. I wanted to create an app where beer enthusiast could locate local breweries that carried a particular beer of their choice. I also wanted to include happy hours that could be easily located on a map. I would like to still finish this project off and present it to employers right not its in the functioning stage not in the completed stage. I still need to add a better API and implement Google Maps. I did add in the Google Sign-in as an authentication method and laid out the wireframe.

                My most recent project I made was for my current employer. I work in the Library and Education Departments, and we wanted to create a self-check in system for our clients. Its a very simple design and very easy to use. I am currently in the stage of adding more features such as adding a Google Calendar so clients can set up appointments and creating QR codes to link our social media pages.

            <p>
                This project was my very first Raspberry Pi program using motion sensors and lights. What made this project difficult was figuring out how I could implement an IoT device into everyday lives. The idea came to me when my professor ask us to choose something that we could use in our own life. Since I deal with an overflowing of trash in my household, I wanted some way I could track it so that I could remember to tell someone. The way I implemented it was using a sensor to measure the waste and when it was full it beeped until someone went over to change it out. Then when someone did it would send a text message saying it was completed. Go IoT!
