            My coding journey started back in May of 2019. I ventured into one of the Deep Dive Bootcamps with Central NM Community College's Ingenuity Program. I entered into their Java + Android Bootcamps and immediatly developed a love/hate relationship with coding. (I love it when my program runs and hate it when it runs but with bugs. :P ) I know that this relationship was going to last a lifetime because I was crazy enough to continued on my journey and applied to Central NM Community College and entered into the Computer Programming program along with the Cyber Security and the Systems Administration programs. I will be completed in the Fall of 2022 obtaining my associates degree in all three of those majors. At the same time since I want to go further and receive my bachelor's degree I applied and was accepted into the NM Highlands University for Fall 2021 into their System Software Design Program. I will be receiving that degree in Fall 2023. I know my journey will not stop there as I have so many projects that I want to make, but most importantly I want to lay down a solid foundation first so that I can build on top of that.

                Let me give you a short intro about myself. I’m a prolific Software Developer. I learned about coding from various online courses and attended many virtual and in-person events to gain knowledge. I also am on my journey in schooling to obtain my bachelor's degree in System Software Designing.

                In my work journey, I have worked for a few companies and currently I am contracting as an IT Technician. My whole work journey revolves around three words which you will learn below.
